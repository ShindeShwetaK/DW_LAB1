# Data Warehousing Lab 1
# Gayatri Patil and Shweta Shinde

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Data Warehousing course at San Jose State University. The objective of Lab 1 is to demonstrate the process of data loading, forecasting, and data transformation using Apache Airflow and Snowflake. The lab focuses on establishing a data pipeline that connects a source database, processes the data, and loads it into a Snowflake data warehouse for analysis.

## Problem Statement

In the context of this lab, the primary challenge is to build a robust data pipeline that effectively handles data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from a source API into Snowflake. Additionally, we aim to perform time series forecasting on stock prices and enhance our dataset by creating lag and difference columns to better analyze trends.

## Procedures Followed

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Installed necessary libraries and set up the development environment for Apache Airflow and Snowflake.

2. **Data Extraction**
   - Connected to the source API and extracted the relevant datasets required for analysis.
   - For this Lab 1 we are using Starbucks(SBUX) and New York Times(NYT) stock data.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Implemented data cleaning and transformation processes to prepare the data.

4. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the transformed data into the Snowflake main table using Apache Airflow DAGs using incremental load.

5. **Forecasting**
   - Utilized statistical models to forecast stock prices based on historical data.
   - Evaluated the accuracy of the forecasts to ensure reliability.
     
6. **Volumn Trend**
  -  Created new table with lag and difference columns to facilitate time series analysis.

7. **Results**
   - Summarized the results of the forecasting model and provided insights based on the analysis.

8. **Data Visulization**
   - Create plots for better understanding of data and stock trends.

## Conclusion

The lab successfully demonstrated the end-to-end process of building a data pipeline, from data extraction to loading into a Snowflake data warehouse. Building a ML forcasting model, new table for undersang volumn difference using LAG. The plots implemention gives a clear picture of correlation of the stocks and how the trent changes.
This experience enhanced our understanding of data warehousing concepts and practical application in real-world scenarios.
